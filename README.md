# Gaussian-elimination
Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting in C++.
The algorithm returns the row echelon form (upper triangular matrix) of the input matrix in place of the input matrix.
The input matrix contains random floating point values from a user-defined interval, drawn from a uniform distribution.

Execute by:

./gaussianElimination.out arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5

where:

arg1: Number of rows
arg2: Number of columns
arg3: Lower bound of the random variables interval
arg4: Upper bound of the random variables interval
arg5: 1 for printing initial and final matrices, and 0 for not printing anything
